        <p>This project spec involves an overview of work done, featuring from part 1 to 5.</p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Ray Generation and Intersection</h2>
    <p>1. Pipeline. I'll begin with generating ray. In below diagram from lecture slide, we cast rays from the pinhole through
        the image plane and then into the scene. The image plane rendered will be the output. In this part, for each pixel in the frame,
        one camera ray is constructed and casted into the scene. If the ray intersects any objects, compute the color
        of the object at the intersection point and assign the color to the corresponding pixel.<br>
        2. Triangle Intersection. Check if the min, maxes match with our corresponding ray and triangle,
        then we are able to update the intersection details, such that now we are able to check if,
        the norm is updated. The most interesting part is regarding the norms, that we initially failed to
        update the sequence of the norm, since the MT algorithm is different from the sequencing of the nodes
        of the respective triangels.</p>

        <h2 align="middle">Part 2: Bounding Volume Hierarchy</h2>
        <p>1. BVH Construction Pipeline: We started by the creating of new leaf nodes, then expand the corresponding bbox
          as well as the centroid bbox. Then, we consider a careful split, and the function partition came to extreme effect
          because I realised that the vectors would be thrown away should we close the current function frame. Hence, we can
          only operate on the initial settings and change the sequence of corresponding iterators.<br></p>

            <p>2. The speedup was not initially significant, coming from 40+s to 7s for the cow.dae, yet the greatest speedup came
            from the moment that I reduced the line: <br> for (auto p : primitives) <br> and replace it by
           <br> for (auto p = node.start; p != node.end; p++) <br> and this significantly reduced the
            time to 0.172s for cow, and 0.45s for maxplanck. I believe the nuances would be i dont have to iterate over all the
            respective primitves, rather, we only need to care if the node includes.</p>

            <h2 align="middle">Part 3: Direct Illumination</h2>
            <p>1. Direct Lighting Pipeline:For uniform hemisphere sampling, we sample the incident ray at a hit point randomly since we
              don't know the position of the light source. If the ray intersects with some objects in the scene, we calculate how much
              light is emitting from that intersection point and scale it to get its contribution to our primary ray (L_out, output ray
              from hit point). If the incident ray doesn't intersect with any object, we skip it.<br></p>
              <p>
              2. Differences in Uniform and lighting:Using uniform hemisphere sampling and lighting sampling on Cbunny.dae. With the same number of samples,
              hemisphere sampling is much more noisy than lighting sampling.</p>

                <h2 align="middle">Part 4: Global Illumination</h2>
                <p>The function est_radiance_global_illumination is called to get an estimate of the total radiance with
                  global illumination arriving at a point from a particular direction, e.g., on the image plane and going
                  towards the image's center of projection. The function zero_bounce_radiance should return the results
                  from no bounces of light, which is simply the light emitted by the given point along its
                  outgoing direction. The pixel will be black unless it lies on a light. The function one_bounce_radianc
                  e is the direct illumination that we have implemented in Part 3. We only need to call our direct
                  lighting function according to the indicator direct_illumination_sample. Hence implementation of only
                  at_leat_once is of importance.
                  The function at_least_one_bounce_radiance calls one_bounce_radiance, and then recursively call itself to
                  estimate the higher bounces. This recursive call takes one random sample from the bsdf at the hit point,
                  trace a ray in that sample direction, and recursively call itself on the new hit point.<br></p>
